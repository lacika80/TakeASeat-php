## Restaurant table reservation management software (language: Hungarian)
I am making this project to practice using the php language, but the more I see into it, the more I would
switch to nodejs if I don't get a job that requires the use of php.

So i decided to make this projekt into a working program only with the skeleton functions.

by that I mean:
- login with google and with normal email/pw (with verification, forgotten pw, remember me function)
- create restaurant(s)
- create tables (list view)
- take, delete reservation
- permission system (with local restaurant and global admin)
